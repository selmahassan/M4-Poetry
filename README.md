# M4-Poetry

I used Vercel for deployment which you can see using this link: https://m4-poetry.vercel.app/

Some notes to consider:

The data takes a couple seconds to load in the browser. Is there any advice for that?

Unfortunately, with the static implementation of my map, the visualizations does not synchronize to my poem. For M5, I am planning to have the lines highlight specific geographical regions within the map. For example, in verse 2, when I discuss the central park 5 case, I will focus soley on new york allowing the user to zoom into that part of the map.

The data represented on the map is the total prison popuplation proportional to the population of each county in the U.S. so it is considering that not every state or county has the same population.
